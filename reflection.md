What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

- Margin in the spacing between other elements and the border.  The border is the edge of the element between the margin and the padding.  The padding is the actual stuff in the box and is the spacing between the content and the padding.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

- Display block stacks elements on top of each other.  Dispaly inline makes them fit side-by-side on the same line.  Display inline-block displays an element as an inline-level block container. The inside of this block is formatted as block-level box, and the element itself is formatted as an inline-level box

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

- I'm very new to CSS, so changing font familys, text colors, and text size is very easy.  I'm still finding positioning elements on the page to be difficult.  When I look up all the possibilities, I just don't know what they do and their descriptions do not visually make sense to me.  I will have to keep playing around with them before it finally makes sense.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

- The most important thing I learned in the challenge is that you can link a second stylesheet below a main stylesheet.  The order matters and all the stylings from the first or default sheet will apply, but they can be overwritten in the second stylesheet if they are given a different style attribute.
