  <h1>Using Git and GitHub </h1>
  <h2>The Many Benefits of Version Control</h2>
  <h4>September 11, 2015</h4>

      Git is an open-source version control management system that allows developers to track changes made on their code files throughout the lifetime of a project.  Git exists locally on a personâ€™s computer.  Github is a social coding website that allows developers to share their code and keep track of their changes using Git.  It exists remotely online.

        Version control is the ability to save multiple versions of a project so that they can be reviewed or tracked.  GitHub is great because it allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time and tells you when a change was made, who made it, what they called the change, what file they changed, what they deleted and what they added to the code.

    <p>
        Developers use version control and websites like GitHub to keep track of changes in their code.  This is useful if a mistake is made or an earlier version is needed.  It is also important when a developer is working on the same files with other people.  Instead of sending a file back and forth to work on it, they can all work on the same files at the same time and merge them together.
