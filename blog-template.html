- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
We both agreed at the beginning that we would use different wireframes.  We both had different ideas of what we wanted to do, but we talked about it and had fun discussing how we made and how we use a wireframe.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I think sketching something on a piece of paper is all that I will do in the future if I am working on my own.  But I can understand if I am collaborating with someone else or have to get approval before coding begins, then I would use a virtual tool to make a wireframe first.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We agreed for a blog there should be a blog title, post title and space for the post body, then some sidebar links to help navigate the blog.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn't learn any new elements, but my partner had more experience in HTML than I did and was kind enough to clarify to me what and when to use the <section> tags in HTML5 as opposed to using the <div> tags as we were taught on Codecademy.
